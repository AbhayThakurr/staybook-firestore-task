This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Update input should behave like this

when the user clickes on the input save, cancel button should appear and if after typyin or removing any charecter from the input user clickes on cancel button then the last data that is available in the datbase should get reverted and if the user clickes on save the field will get updated without page reload and the input value should be the latest value if the user by any chance reloades the page
